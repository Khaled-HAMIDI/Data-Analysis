# DATA Analysis

## Bike_share_proejct (project for the "Programming for data science for entreprise" Nanodegree):
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Investigate_Sakila_Movie_Database
I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals.I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database.
The database file is in zipformat ( dvdrental.zip) so you need to extract it to  dvdrental.tar before loading the sample database into the PostgreSQL database server.

## Ecommerce_Purchases
I answered a relevent questions about some Fake Data about some purchases done through Amazon

## SF_Salaries
I analysed the SF_Salaries DataSet from Kaggle with python librairies Numpy and Pandas
